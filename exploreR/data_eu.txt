Year: year of measurement (1980-2004)

Gender: gender of measured persons, male or female

BMI_Index: The mean BMI (Body Mass Index) counted in kilogram per
	   square meter; this mean is calculated as if each country has the same
	   age composition as the world population (23.38133-28.00844), source:
	   Gapminder Indicator_BMI male ASM and Indicator_BMI female ASM

Bloodpressure: systolic blood pressure age standardized mean in mm Hg
	       (119.9665-143.1237), source: Gapminder Indicator_SBP male ASM and
	       Indicator_SBP female ASM

Cholesterol: The mean TC (Total Cholesterol) of the population,
	     counted in mmol per L (4.501741-6.240528); this mean is
	     calculated as if each country has the same age
	     composition as the world population, source: Gapminder
	     Indicator_TC male ASM and Indicator_TC female ASM

Sugar: The food consumption quantity (grams per person and day) of
       sugar and sweeters (5.48-167.12), 
       source: Gapminder indicator sugar_consumption

Income: Gross Domestic Product per capita by Purchasing Power Parities

	taken into account, source: Gapminder Income per person (fixed
	PPP$) (version 17)

Life_expectancy: The average number of years (62.7-81.1) a newborn
		 child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the
		 same. Observations after 2010 are based on projections by the UN,
		 source: Gapmninder indicator life_expectancy_at_birth_1800-2050

Region: Region to which the European country belongs to (Northern
	Europe, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Western Europe).

Period: Period in which the data is measured. The measurement period
	1980-2004 is split into three periods:
